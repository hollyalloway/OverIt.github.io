                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p5>After a lifetime of lesbianism Lily Fulton was well and truly fed up with men. Through a truly heartfelt ramble with friend Holly Alloway, the two came up with the concept for “Over it”. The company is dedicated to bettering womens interactions with everyday men. From “anti mansplain pills” to “anti geez glasses” to “anti man tang”, Over It is committed to creating locally made, eco friendly products that turns YOUR average Joe into a kind, thoughtful companion who smells like pure joy and turns his male gaze to art, film and ocean views.

                        <br><br>Here at Over It, we pride ourselves on having products that are animal cruelty-free, eco friendly and recyclable. The packaging is made from melted down prison furniture and the labels are ripped off of anchor milk bottles that we made unpaid primary school children colour in for us. Supporting the economy and giving the youth valuable work experience that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives is very important to us. 
                        
                        <br><br>Aside from the child labourers, our team is made of 5 key members. CEO - Holly Alloway, Deputy CEO - Lily Fulton, Marketing - John McJohn Johnathan, Production - Terry McTerrance and Design - Paul McCartney. If you have any enquiries please follow the instructions on our contact page. Enjoy our products & go local! </p5>
